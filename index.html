            <p>
              Hello, my name is Cyrus Herrera and I am a student in IIT's
              ITMD 361 with Professor Stolley.I am a Sophomore studying
              ITM with a focus on System/IT Administration. I fell in love
              with the field at a young age. I always loved computers,
              and as I got older I started to work more and more with them.
              Eventually I landed ajob at my highschool where I repair and
              manage a lot of the technology at the school. Apart from
              technology, I really love music. I make a lot of instrumentals
              using this program called FL Studio. It's a hoppy I have
              been keeping up with for about a decade now, bbut I'm hoping
              that in the future I can make some real money from it.
